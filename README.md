## Hi! Holi! GrÃ¼ÃŸi! 

I am Mafalda GonzÃ¡lez GonzÃ¡lez, a Spanish-German student currently looking for position in a company that will enable me to grow and learn! Of course, I am excited to contribute with my technical capacities and personal qualities, which you can check out below :) 

- ðŸ“« Currently, I am finishing my **Master's degree** in **Computational Social Science** at Charles III University of Madrid. Here is where my GitHub journey started! Feel free to check out projects such as the [Flight Information scraper]([url](https://github.com/mafaldi/data-harvesting)) or my [Data Visualisation recreation project ]([url](https://csslab.uc3m.es/dataviz/projects/2024/100546612/)).
- ðŸŒ± I am currently also working on my **Thesis Project**, which relates to **Election Forecasting and Poll House Effects**. The work I am doing contributes to the work-in-progress R package of [pollspain]([url](https://github.com/dadosdelaplace/pollspain)).
- ðŸ’¬ I have a **Bachelors of Arts in Social Sciences**, obtained at Charles University in Prague. As it is an international degree, I did the whole thing in English, which my C2 Cambridge Advanced certificate will gladly back up. Further, during the degree, I did an Erasmus exchange at Alma Mater Studiorum in Bologna. Hence, while my Czech is not the best (it is a _very_ difficult language), I did manage to learn Italian.
- âš¡ **Fun fact**: every year I work at the **Oktoberfest** in Munich, as I grew up there, and the work is as stressful as it is exciting. If you are interested in talking to me, feel free to ask me about my craziest stories! They are quite ridiculous. 

As you see, I have moved a lot, and learned even more from all of these experiences. 

If you find my profile interesting, I'd be happy to chat about any opportunity you might have for me!
